Given a graph I need to find the cheapest paths with the maximum amount of flow.
To do this I need to use the bellmanford algorithm to find the shortest one at a time.
Once I have found a shortest path I need to update the residual matrix so that when I come to find the next shortest path there will be negative flows avalible to me,
so when the next cheapest path is found it will take the negative flows so that many flows can get from source to sink
